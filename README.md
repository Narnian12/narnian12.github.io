# Personal Website

Hi! Welcome to my website hosted both on [Github Pages](https://narnian12.github.io) and [Netlify](https://ps-portfolio.netlify.app/) :) While most of my formal education was in back-end development, it is nice to be able to see what front-end has to offer.

I also wanted to have a place where I can showcase all that I am working on that is more descriptive and (hopefully) fun than a resume.

I hope you enjoy your stay!
