# Personal Website

Hi! Welcome to my [website](https://ps-portfolio.netlify.app/) :) While most of my formal education was in back-end development, it is nice to be able to see what front-end has to offer.

The primary motivation of my website is to develop a UI that uses as few external libraries as possible. I am hoping that the sacrifice of more
elegant design will be outweighed by the experience I gain from making my own nav bars, media queries, and the like. I want to improve my problem-solving
abilities more than the quality of my portfolio (even though elegance is a nice addition).

I also wanted to have a place where I can showcase all that I am working on that is more descriptive and (hopefully) fun than a resume.

I hope you enjoy your stay!
